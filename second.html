    <div class="introduction">
        <p>
            By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on his promise to build an economy
            that works for working families, including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
            NHPI) families. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers prescription drug costs, health care costs, and
            energy costs. It’s the most aggressive action we have taken to confront the climate crisis. It’ll lower
            the deficit and ask the super wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And no one making under
            $400,000 per year will pay a penny more in taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special interests to pass this historic
            legislation that lowers costs for Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
            building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.

        <h2>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h2>
        <p>
            The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs, including prescription drug costs, and
            expand health insurance coverage for AA and NHPI families.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lower Prescription Drug Costs for Seniors: Americans pay 2-3 times more for their prescription drugs
            than people in other wealthy countries. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans struggle to afford prescription drugs,
            and high prices contribute to racial and ethnic health inequities. The Inflation Reduction Act will help
            close the gap in access to medication by improving prescription drug coverage and lowering drug prices
            in Medicare. The law:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs they buy at the pharmacy at
                $2,000 a year, giving peace of mind to seniors who no longer have to worry about spending thousands
                and thousands more on prescription drugs.
            </li>

            <li>
                Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a month’s supply.

            </li>

            <li>
                Provides access to a number of additional free vaccines, including the shingles vaccine, for
                Medicare beneficiaries.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER
        </h2>

        <p>
            President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ 2017 tax law only made an unfair tax system worse. The
            Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making our tax code fairer. It will raise
            revenue by:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes they already owe.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get away with paying no federal
                income tax.
            </li>

            <li>
                Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks that will encourage businesses to invest
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The legislation’s tax reforms won’t just raise revenue to finance critically needed investments to lower
            costs and combat climate change, they are also an important component of building an economy that
            rewards work rather than wealth and doesn’t let the rich and powerful get away with playing by a
            separate set of rules.
        </p>

        <p>

            Millions of working families will have better access to the benefits they are entitled to under the tax
            code and be able to get their questions answered quickly and efficiently, thanks to the Act’s
            transformational investments in the Internal Revenue Service. And, no family making less than $400,000
            per year will see their taxes go up by a single cent.
